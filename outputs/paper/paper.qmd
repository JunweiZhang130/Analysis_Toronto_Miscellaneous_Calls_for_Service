## 1 Introduction

As one of the largest municipal police services in North America, Toronto Police Service and its Communications Centre serve the city with the largest population in Canada. The call centre answers all emergency 9-1-1 calls for police, fire and ambulance across the city. Operators are responsible for transferring to the appropriate emergency response team, dispatching police services when required, and assigning a priority level to the call.

The data about Toronto Emergency Call Centre is indispensable in helping improve the responding speed. Understanding who is calling, the types of phone calls that were receiving, the changes that occurs in different years, can help the Toronto Police Service better respond emergencies that happens in the city, and ensure a relatively safe and trusting environment for every member who lives and works at Toronto. The access of open source dataset also helps transparency, promote trust and gain meaningful insights from the data, while doing so in a secure and compliant environment.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 covers the data source and analysis methodology employed. Section 3 then examines key dimensions of the data, proposing conclusions and areas of further exploration.
